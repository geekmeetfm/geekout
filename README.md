Primarily, this repo was spawned to facilitate geeky discussions; using either the issue queue or the correlating [gitter.im geekout chat channel](https://gitter.im/geekmeetfm/geekout), or both.

Code and other stuff is fine of course. Organization is whatever. Basically anything goes, starting out :)
